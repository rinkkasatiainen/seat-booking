# Tests

## Purpose

This is a containing folder for all tests. There are different levels of testing done in this repo, all for 
'serving as an example'. The naming of the folders - and thus the levels of testing - can and will be improved during the
course of this repository. Please help with the naming.

## Things to consider (some might say 'improve')

What to do with 'utils' folder?  It is duplicated in many of the folders here.
