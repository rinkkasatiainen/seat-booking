# Unit Tests

## Purpose

Unit tests are fast. These are the test cases that do not read anything from file system / db. 
These don't make any network calls - or calls to rabbimMQ. Unit tests are 
Fast, Isolated, Repeatable, Self-validating (and Stably), and Timely - well, less timely written, but exists.

## Things to consider (some might say 'improve')
